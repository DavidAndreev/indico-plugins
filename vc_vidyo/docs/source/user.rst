==========================
Videoconferences in events
==========================

Indico allows event managers to attach `Vidyo <http://www.vidyo.com>`_ rooms to
their events and users can join from the event page.

If videoconferences have been booked for a meeting or a lecture, they will be
displayed in the event page. On a conference, they can be found in the section
*Videoconference Rooms* of the side menu.

----------------------
Join a videoconference
----------------------

To launch an ongoing Vidyo videoconference just click on the *Join* button. This
will redirect to the Vidyo Portal where the participant will be asked for their
account name and password. If they are not yet registered in the system, guest
access and PIN protected access is also allowed.

After logging in, the VidyoDesktop client (which is required to be installed in
the participant's computer) will open and you will receive/send video and audio
from/to the meeting.

For information about registration, please go to
`Vidyo Service <http://cern.ch /vidyo-service/>`_.
