Videoconference management
==========================

Indico allows attaching Vidyo rooms to an event and other users can see
information about these in the public pages of the events. This can be
accomplished within the *Videoconference* menu in the event management area by
either:

- The creator of an event
- An event manager
- A videoconference service manager

This page shows all Vidyo rooms attached to the event and allows to modify their
configuration as well as attaching existing rooms, creating new ones or
detaching them.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Attaching an existing Vidyo room
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clicking on the *Add existing room* button will make a Vidyo room search dialog
appear. Here, existing rooms can be found by name and attached to the event.
Also, some basic settings can be configured directly before attaching.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Creating a Vidyo room

Clicking on the *Create Vidyo room* will redirect to the Vidyo room creation
form. Here, all details concerning the room can be specified. Upon completion,
the room will be attached to the event.
