Event statistics
================

Indico tracks statistics of events. Depending on the configuration applied by
the server administrator, this feature allows event managers to view where the
traffic is coming from, peak dates and track downloads of material.

If enabled in the server, event statistics can be found in the menu section
*Statistics* of the event management area. Note that results are cached and that
the report creation date is displayed at the page footer.

The default date range and scope for the results can be modified by clicking on
*Modify Query*.

selection (conference / contribution). It can be zoomed by clicking and dragging
the cursor and hovering over the data points will display more information.
