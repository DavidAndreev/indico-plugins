Configuring Piwik
=================

Statistics in Indico rely on Piwik. This guide explains how to configure the
plugin to interface with a Piwik server. It assumes access to a Piwik server and
the ability to login and retrieve both the ``idSite`` and ``token_auth``
variables provided by Piwik API.

Piwik plugin configuration can be found in
*Server admin > Plugins > Piwik statistics*.
